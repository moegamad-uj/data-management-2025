# Oceanic Manta Rays in Fiji: Dataset and Analysis

## Dataset Overview

This repository contains data and analysis scripts related to the study titled *"First photographic evidence of oceanic manta rays (*Mobula birostris*) at two locations in the Fiji islands"* by Luke Gordon and Tom Vierus, published in *PeerJ* (2022). The study provides the first confirmed photographic records of oceanic manta rays in Fijian waters..

## Purpose of the Dataset

The dataset serves to:
- **Document Occurrences**: Record *M. birostris* sightings in Fiji, expanding the known distribution of the species.
- **Individual Identification**: Use unique ventral spot patterns to track individuals over time.
- **Behavioural Insights**: Provide data on manta ray behaviours such as feeding and cruising.

## Data Source

The dataset originates from the supplementary materials of the original publication, accessible via DOI: [10.7717/peerj.13883](https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.13883).

## Metadata

The dataset includes the following key components:

- **Sighting Records**
  - `ID No.`: Unique identifier for individual manta rays.
  - `Sex`: Sex of the individual (if known).
  - `Size Class`: Classification by size.
  - `Re-sight (Y/N)`: Whether the individual was re-sighted.
  - `Region` & `Location`: Geographic information about where the sighting occurred.
  - `Date` & `Time`: Timestamp of the sighting.
  - `Behavioural Activity`: Observed behaviour (e.g., feeding, cruising).
  - `Source` & `Source Type`: Observer and affiliation.
  - `No. Remora`: Presence and number of remoras.
  - `Preg / FMW / YoY`: Reproductive status indicators.
  - `New Injury`: Notes on any observed injuries.
  - `Comments`: Additional observational notes.
